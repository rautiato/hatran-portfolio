						Hi, I am Ha. I have the bachelor’s degree from the University of Natural Science which is one of 
						the renowned universities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. My major is Mathematics and 
						Computer Science.
					</p>						
					<p>
						After graduation from the University, I became a Software Tester. In the projects that I attended,
						I was responsible for ensuring the quality of software products, analyzing requirements, 
						designing test cases, executing test cases, submitting and retesting defects, and
						reporting testing status to Managers.
					</p>
					<P>
						In 2018, I came to Canada for further studying. Recently, I graduated from the post graduate 
						program of the Information Technology Business Analysis from Conestoga College as one of the toppers 
						of the program with distinction on the Dean’s Honour List (GPA: 3.72).
					</P>
					<p>
						I have a strong passion for coding. My objective is looking for a position of Junior Web Developer where
						I can apply my experience in software testing and develop new skills.

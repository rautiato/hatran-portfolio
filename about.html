					<p>
						Hi, I am Ha. I have the bachelor&apos;s degree from the University of Natural Science which is one of 
						the renowned universities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. My major is Mathematics and 
						Computer Science.
					</p>						
					<p>
						After graduation from the University, I became a Software Tester. In the projects that I attended,
						I was responsible for ensuring the quality of software products, analyzing requirements, 
						designing test cases, executing test cases, submitting and retesting defects, and
						reporting testing status to Managers.
					</p>
					<P>
						In 2018, I came to Canada for further studying. Recently, I graduated from the post graduate 
						program of the Information Technology Business Analysis from Conestoga College as one of the toppers 
						of the program with distinction on the Dean&apos;s Honour List (GPA: 3.72).
					</P>
					<p>
						I have a strong passion for coding. My objective is looking for a position of Junior Web Developer where
						I can apply my experience in software testing and develop new skills.
					</p>
